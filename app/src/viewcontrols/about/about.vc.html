<h1>This is how we roll..</h1>
<p>With "Play My Song", you now have the ability to 
    request your favorite song to be played live. Now that 
    is a lot power. However there are no garauntees that yours is the request
    that will be chosen, that is also, not to say the band won't
    choose your song and give you a shoutout as well. This 
    app, typically reserved in other domains as a VIP exclusive 
    service, now sits at your fingertips. Make a request and 
    tell us about your experience if your song is selected 
    at the show!

<p>For those of you interested in using "Play My Song" to 
    show your die hard fans a good time. Signing up is as easy
    as registering your page and an event from our home page. 
    We offer a page that will show all of your requests as well
    as the history of your events. And just think, if your fans
    hate this app we offer a no money back garuntee! We hope you
    find this a fun way to interact with your fanbase and keep up
    with the song reqeest patterns that may vary by city. Enjoy!
